**Image to Pencil Sketch with Python**:  Use CV2 library to convert image to pencil sketch.
During my internship, I was fascinated by the field of image processing and the artistic transformations it can bring to digital images. The concept of transforming ordinary photos into pencil sketches struck me as a unique and visually appealing technique.

Here are the 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩-𝐛𝐲-𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 to convert an image to a pencil sketch using Python:

𝟏. Install the necessary libraries: 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐂𝐕.
𝟐. Import the required libraries: 𝐂𝐕𝟐 & 𝐈𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐧.
𝟑. Load the image.
𝟒. Convert the image to grayscale.
𝟓. Invert the grayscale image.
𝟔. Apply Gaussian blur to the inverted image:
𝟕. Blend the grayscale image with the blurred image using the "colour dodge" blending mode.
𝟖. Save the pencil sketch.
